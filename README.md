#jupyter

Docker image for Jupyter on TAP.

Two images are used:
- jupyter-base - includes the parts that rarely change, e.g. 3rd party libraries
- jupyter (this project) - includes most of our customizations and is layered on top of the jupyter-base

The image was split into two parts for faster builds and deploys.

## Building the image
- Build the jupyter-base image first and tag it
- Pull all the submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive
- Update the the Dockerfile where it reads: FROM "quay.io/trustedanalytics/jupyter-base" to point to your jupyter-base image tag
- sudo docker build .
- Or if you are behind a proxy use this:
- sudo docker build --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy --build-arg NO_PROXY=$no_proxy --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg no_proxy=$no_proxy .

## Run the image:
- sudo docker run -p 8900:8888 YOUR_JUPYTER_IMAGE_TAG
