    "\n",
    "Apache Spark&trade; is a general engine for cluster scale computing. It provides API's for multiple languages including Python, Scala, and SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to run Spark in both local and yarn-client modes within TAP, as well as using Spark Submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several [Spark examples](/tree/examples/spark) are included with TAP and [others](http://spark.apache.org/examples.html) are available on the [Spark website](http://spark.apache.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [PySpark API documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) for more information on the API's below.\n",

    "## Supported Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the YARN scheduler is supported on TAP and Spark jobs can be ran in three different modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode | Good for Big Data | Supports Interactive Sessions | Supports Batch Jobs | Runtime | Use With | Best For\n",
    "---------- | --- | -- | --- | --- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------\n",
    "**Local mode** | No | Yes | Yes | Both driver and workers run locally | pyspark, spark-shell, spark-submit | Fast small scale testing in an interactive shell or batch.  Best mode to start with if you are new to Spark.\n",
    "**Yarn Client** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Driver runs locally and workers run in cluster | pyspark, spark-shell, spark-submit | Big data in an interactive shell.\n",
    "**Yarn Cluster** | Yes | No | Yes | Both driver and workers run in cluster | spark-submit | Big data batch jobs.\n",
